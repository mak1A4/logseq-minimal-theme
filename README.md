# logseq-minimal-theme
My take on a minimal theme for logseq

> This theme also contains some javascript, be aware that even if you switch the theme
> this javascript code will always run in the current implementation of logseq (0.7.3)
> to stop the code from running either deaktivate the theme entirely or change the setting
